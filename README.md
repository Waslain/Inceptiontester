# Inceptiontester

Inceptiontester was made to test my inception project. (Who would have guessed)

## Setup
Git clone the repo next to your inception folder

## Compilation time !
```
g++ *.cpp
```

## Usage
Cd into your Inception directory then :
```
../Inceptiontester/a.out
```
After that it's self-explanatory.
Tips: You can use 'n' to go to the next command
